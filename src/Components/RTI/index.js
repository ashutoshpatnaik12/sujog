                <h2>Right to information</h2>
                <p>"Right to Information Act, 2005 (22 of 2005)
                An Act to provide for setting out the practical regime of right to information for citizens to secure access to
                information under the control of public authorities, in order to promote transparency and accountability in the
                working of every public authority, the constitution of a Central Information Commission and State Information
                Commissions and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.

                <p>
                  Whereas the Constitution of India has established democratic Republic; And whereas democracy requires an informed citizenry
                  and transparency of information which are vital to its functioning and also to contain corruption and to hold Governments
                  and their instrumentalities accountable to the governed; And whereas revelation of information in actual practice is likely
                  to conflict with other public interests including efficient operations of the Governments, optimum use of limited fiscal
                  resources and the preservation of confidentiality of sensitive information; And whereas it is necessary to harmonize these
                  conflicting interests while preserving the paramountcy of the democratic ideal; Now, therefore, it is expedient to provide
                  for furnishing certain information to citizens who desire to have it.
